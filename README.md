# pdfviewer
The purpose of this project is to allow users to view pdf files and offer them the ability to magnify, turn to the right, left or 
upside down if presented in wrongside up.  I would also like to give them the ability to magnify the pdf, darken or lighten the image
sharpen it and scroll through the pdf as they may be many pages.  This can be accomplished through a viewbox.  

I would also like to include a total of how many pages are included in the file and a name of the file on the page.  The date the file was 
uploaded would be a plus.  Some CSS to make it professional would be great.  

I'm using phpMySql in WAMP. 
If someone has a recommendation on another solution, I'm open.
